    "Q3 compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in python with examples\n",
    "Ans: In Python, Every variable in Python holds an instance of an object. There are two types of objects in Python i.e. Mutable and Immutable objects. Whenever an object is instantiated, it is assigned a unique object id. The type of the object is defined at the runtime and it can’t be changed afterward. However, its state can be changed if it is a mutable object.\n",
    "    Immutable Objects are of in-built datatypes like int, float, bool, string, Unicode, and tuple. In simple words, an immutable object can’t be changed after it is created.\n",
    "    Mutable Objects are of type Python list, Python dict, or Python set. Custom classes are generally mutable."

    "Q4 Discuss the different types of operators in Python and provide examples of how they are used.\n",
    "Ans: Python operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values. These operators allow for various functionalities, from basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to more complex comparisons and logical operations. Python provides several types of operators, including arithmetic operators for mathematical calculations, comparison operators to compare values, and assignment operators to assign values to variables. Additionally, there are logical operators for combining conditional statements, bitwise operators for manipulating individual bits of data, membership operators to check if a value is part of a sequence, and identity operators to compare the memory locations of objects. Understanding and effectively using these operators is crucial for performing various tasks in Python programming.\n",
